<h5>What is a Relational Database?</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into one or more tables or relations, with each table consisting of a set of rows and columns.</p></li>
<li><p> In a relational database, the data is stored in a structured format, with each row representing a unique record and each column representing a specific attribute or piece of data related to that record.</p></li>
<li><p>The relationships between the tables in a relational database are defined by common fields or keys, which are used to link the tables together. For example, in a database for an online store, there might be separate tables for customers, orders, and products, with a common key linking each order to a specific customer and product.</p></li>

<li><p>Relational Database provides following advantages over other type of databses:- </p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Data integrity:-</b>Relational databases use strict rules for data validation and integrity, which helps to ensure that the data is accurate and consistent.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Querying flexibility:-</b>With SQL, the standard language used for querying relational databases, it's easy to retrieve and analyze data from multiple tables and create complex queries.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Scalability:-</b>Are highly scalable, allowing them to handle large amounts of data and grow as your business needs change.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Security:-</b> Offer several security features, such as user authentication, access controls, and data encryption.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Examples of popular relational database management systems (RDBMS) include <b>Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.</b></p></li>
</ul>
